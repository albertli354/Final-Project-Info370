      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>Through the project, we gained valuable experience in machine learning. We have several things that would like to share with you. 
        First of all, we learned that machine learning is an iterative process and it is really important to build a simple model in the first and then improve it iteratively. 
        Since we are not the experts in the field of image recognition, it was hard for us to find the right direction. 
        In this case, we first build a model and use it to find the clues to improve our model.</p>
        <p>Another important thing is to keep the evaluation standard consistent as much as possible. During the modelling, we used different approaches to calculate the accuracy. 
          However, since the standards are different, it was really hard for us to directly compare performance for different models. 
          We learned that using a simple method to evaluate the results is actually the best approach. 
          </p>
      <p>In the future, we may build up our own model to test the accuracy and facilitate these industries which authenticate and 
        identify the users who use their system or product. 
        Itâ€™s also meaningful for the social application. 
        For example, a system can separate different group of age (e.g., teenagers or adults) 
        using a scanner or digital recognizer based on the writing style.</p>

      <p>This is the final project for INFO 370 in the University of Washington. 
          You can find all the raw data in <a href="https://github.com/albertli354/Final-Project-Info370/tree/master/data/intermediate/csvs" title="Raw data link" aria-label="CSV files in github">(Processed Raw Data - csv files)</a>. 
          Each branch in the repository contains a different model. You can find statistical model, sklearn model, 
          and tensorflow model in the corresponding branch. </p>
